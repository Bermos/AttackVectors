# Legal Findings

https://www.fec.gov/files/legal/murs/7148/19044475209.pdf

The FEC dismissed the complaint for a couple of reasons. First, the Commission said there was insufficient information to determine whether the various entities (see below...) met the press exemption of the regulations that govern whether expenditures have to be reported to the FEC as campaign contributions.

What is the press exemption, you ask? It's basically a rule that says that if CNN reports on something that Elizabeth Warren is doing, that neither CNN nor Ms. Warren are required to report it as a campaign contribution despite the fact that it costs CNN money to produce the report and broadcast it, which could otherwise reasonably be considered an in-kind campaign contribution (in-kind means a contribution that is not money).

Here, the Commission is saying that they are not able to determine whether this exemption should apply to these fake newspapers or not. Personally, I think that's kind of bullshit, but we'll get there further down in this post.

The other reason they dismissed the complaint is that the Commission says that there was no real evidence of coordination between the campaign and the PAC/companies involved. That's often very hard to prove in the real world. If you ask me, it's DESIGNED to be hard to prove, but that's a topic of conversation for another day.

So, that's the legal crap out of the way. Let's talk about some interesting avenues of further investigation that this decision reveals!

This FEC complaint came from an election for US House of Representatives in 2016 in Illinois. The fake newspapers there were published by a company called Local Government Information Services, Inc. (LGIS). According to the decision, LGIS is partly owned by a guy named Dan Proft.

Who is Dan Proft? In addition to being the co-owner of LGIS, he's also a talk radio host in Illinois and serves as the treasurer for two political action committees (PACs). The PACs are Liberty Principles PAC (federal) and Liberty Principles PAC Inc. State Account.

It turns out that LGIS, the company that made the newspaper websites that is partly owned by Dan Proft, got LOTS of money in donations from Liberty Principles PAC Inc. State Account - who in turn got lots of money from Liberty Principles PAC (the federal one), which are both controlled by Dan Proft.

But there's more! Locality Labs Inc., LLC (also known as LocalLabs) is also involved. If you recall, this company is mentioned specifically in the article in The Atlantic that is referenced in multiple threads on this subreddit about fake newspaper websites.

Locality Labs is owned, at least in part by a guy named Brian Timpone. Timpone also owns (or owned) a company called Newsinator, LLC that is mentioned in the FEC decision. According to the decision, LocalLabs had a contract with LGIS to produce content to be published by LGIS in their "newspapers."

But here's the thing - remember how Dan Proft is only a part owner of LGIS? Do you wonder who the other owner(s) might be? Well, the FEC decision says the Commission doesn't know that exactly. But on page 17-18 oft the decision, they state that news sources suggest that Brian Timpone is (or was) the other co-owner of LGIS.

A couple of other interesting notes:

Page 5, footnote 11 lists some other "publications" that may need to be added to the list on GitHub. Same with page 9, footnote 32.

Page 11 of the decision has a pretty good description of how these publications were distributed including at least temporarily in print.

Page 14 outlines the relationship between LGIS and LocalLabs.

Last interesting note - it looks like some of these sites may have been around since 2012!

## Conclusion/opinions -

FEC regulations are kind of crap and they make it really, really hard to actually find that a candidate or PAC has actually violated election rules or laws. If you ask me, that's by design - but that's not recent, it's been that way for a long time. Certainly, Supreme Court decisions like Citizens United have only made things worse.

The burden of proof is on the person making the complaint to the FEC. What this decision shows us is that, to be successful, you have to come to the Commission with solid evidence that leaves no wiggle room. If there's wiggle room, you're going to lose.

The other takeaway from this decision is that if you can hide things well enough, you can get away with all kinds of propaganda and campaign shenanigans. That means if you want to investigate these things, you have to be willing and able to dig deep.
