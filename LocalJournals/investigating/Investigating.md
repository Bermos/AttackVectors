This is a place for active investigations of various newer local news networks. It is a work in progress area so to speak.
The sites found here have not been labeled "fake" or "real" yet. A number of reasons can cause a publication to end up here:
some ties to known fake networks, proximity of origin IP, same web server, etc. Completed investigations can be found in the
folder labeled as such. Once completed, domains/networks will be determined fake or determined legitimate. Investigations will
be discussed in the MassMove subreddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/MassMove/

Feel free to poke around if you wish!
