# Domain Naming Patterns

While looking through the currently identified domains and [finding some new ones](https://github.com/MassMove/AttackVectors/issues/16#issuecomment-591235742), I noticed some patterns to the domain naming convention and started listing the familiar names used in news publications on the end of the domains.

The naming convention consists of like 2 or 3 parts.
- A cardinal direction (optional, but heavily used)
- A geographical location, state, county, city, or town (required)
- A familiar name used in existing news publications (required)

## Cardinal Direction Examples 
**central**octimes.com
**north**octimes.com
**south**octimes.com
**west**octimes.com
_eastoctimes.com is not registered currently._
