From the [billion-dollar disinformation campaign to reelect the president in 2020](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2020/03/the-2020-disinformation-war/605530/):

>Parscale has indicated that he plans to open up a new front in this  war: local news. Last year, he said the campaign [intends to train  “swarms of surrogates”](https://www.palmbeachpost.com/news/20190531/brad-parscale-genius-who-won-trumps-campaign-and-how-hell-get-him-reelected) to undermine negative coverage from local TV stations and newspapers.

Over the past few years, hundreds of websites with innocuous-sounding names like the Arizona Monitor and The Kalamazoo Times have begun popping up. [At first glance, they look like regular publications, complete with community notices and coverage of schools](https://www.cjr.org/tow_center_reports/hundreds-of-pink-slime-local-news-outlets-are-distributing-algorithmic-stories-conservative-talking-points.php).  But look closer and you’ll find that there are often no mastheads, few if any bylines, and no addresses for local offices. Many of them are  organs of Republican lobbying groups; others belong to a mysterious  company called Locality Labs, which is run by a conservative activist in  Illinois. Readers are given no indication that these sites have political agendas—which is precisely what makes them valuable.
